# NBS_Public

Here is our Template file created by Andreas Hofer for exporting two .csv files.
One file where all Licensed AD Users are included which should be member of the "Schulungsplattform" and the second file includes the deleted users.
The deleted users are the users which are in the old "nbsenabled_$datum" file but not in the new generated one!
